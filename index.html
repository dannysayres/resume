       <u><h3>Summary</h3> </u>
       <p>
        I was brought up in London, United Kingdom with the belief that anything is achievable. At an early age I was encouraged to pursue, any and all ideas that I had in-order to truly understand where my place was.</p>
        <p>With a family background in Financial Services I finished school and embarked on a drive to find myself a job in finance.... With no-one willing to give a recently graduated teenager a chance, and after many knock back before even submitting my CV I decided I needed to be creative. I applied for an intern role in an IT Department of one of the worlds leading Hedge Funds with the intentions of working my way up. This is how I accidentally dedicated my life to technology....and I wouldn’t change a thing!
